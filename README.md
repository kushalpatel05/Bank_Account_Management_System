# Bank Account Management System (OOPs)
This is a beginner-level Python project that simulates basic banking operations like creating users, depositing, withdrawing money, and checking balances â€” all using Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

## Features
- Create multiple bank users
- Deposit & withdraw money with input validation
- Track individual account balances
- Dynamic bank name (can be changed at runtime)
- Uses class variables, static methods, and class methods

## How It Works
- User inputs name, email, and initial balance
- Users can deposit or withdraw based on input
- Bank name can be updated dynamically
- Final account summary is displayed

## Technologies & Concepts Used
- Python class, object, __init__
- Encapsulation (private attributes using __balance)
